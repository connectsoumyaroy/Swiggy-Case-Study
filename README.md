## 🔄 Process Flow:

### 1. Web Scraping ⛏️:
Since Swiggy’s content is dynamic, we used Selenium for automation to scroll through the website and capture data as it loaded. This method allowed us to extract a complete dataset beyond the initially visible content.

### 2. Data Cleaning 🧹:
Using Power Query, we performed several cleaning tasks:
- **Removed Duplicate Entries**: Ensured all records were unique for accurate analysis.
- **Corrected Location Names**: Standardized location data to enable precise geographical insights.
- **Handled Missing Values**: Filtered out incomplete records to maintain data reliability.

### 3. Key Insights 📊:
- **Restaurant Distribution**: Analyzed restaurant concentrations in areas like BTM Layout, Indiranagar, and Koramangala.
- **Dish Pricing**: Found that certain areas like Indiranagar and BTM Layout offered higher-priced dishes, although the base prices were similar across locations.
- **Popular Areas**: Analyzed ratings to identify the most popular dining hubs.
- **Delivery Time vs. Ratings**: Discovered a negative correlation, where increased delivery times led to lower restaurant ratings.
- **Cuisine Popularity**: Identified the top 5-6 cuisines dominating the market, accounting for over half the market share.

## 🔑 Key Insight:
Investing in areas with a high concentration of low-rated restaurants presents a significant business opportunity. Entrepreneurs can fill the gap by offering high-quality food and timely delivery, which can capture the attention of dissatisfied customers and build loyalty.
